A chatbot using Messenger bot API, NodeJS and other things. Testing avec [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel)

# Explanation
The goal is to use the *share* functionality of the api for spread the chatbot to a maximum of person. The usefullness of the chatbot otherwise if totally **null**.
The virality is induced by the subject of the chatbot (mother's user) wich is both taboo and ~~funny~~ not funny.
Once again, the subject here is : Does the virality is reinforced when the form is embarassing for everyone ? That is my problem.

## THIS IS A WIP
